# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

[üîóUdemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/?couponCode=AUG_22_GET_STARTED)

## IAM

### Users & Groups

> IAM: Identity and Access Management, A Global service

* Root account created by default, shouldn‚Äôt be used or shared
* Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
* Groups only contain users, not other groups
* Users don‚Äôt have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

### Permissions

* Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called **policies**
* These policies define the permissions of the users
* In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don‚Äôt give more permissions than a user needs

### IAM Policies Structure

* `Version`: policy language version,always include‚Äú2012-10-17‚Äù
* `Id`: an identifier for the policy(optional)
* `Statement`: one or more individual statements(required)
  * `Sid`: an identifier for the statement(optional)
  * `Effect`: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
  * `Principal`: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
  * `Action`: list of actions this policy allows ordenies
  * `Resource`: list of resources to which the actions applied to
  * `Condition`: conditions for when this policy is ineffect (optional)

### IAM Security Tools

* IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
  * a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
* IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
  * Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
  * You can use this information to revise your policies.

## EC2

> EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud  
> EC2 Instance: AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage + security groups + EC2 User Data

### Sizing & Configuration Options

* Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
* Compute power & Cores (CPU)
* Random-access Memory (RAM)
* Storage Space:
  * Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  * Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
* Network Card: speed of the card, Public IP address
* Firewall Rules: security group
* Bootstrap Script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

### Instance Types

[üîóHomepage](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

* General Purpose: Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
* Compute Optimized: Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
* Memory Optimized: Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
* Storage Optimized: Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage

### Security Groups

* Security groups **only contain allow** rules
* Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
* Security groups are acting as a ‚Äúfirewall‚Äù on EC2 instances
* They regulate:
  * Type + Protocol
    * Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
    * Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)
  * Source: Authorised IP ranges ‚Äì IPv4 and IPv6 / other security group
  * Port Range
* Locked down to a region / VPC combination
* It‚Äôs good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
* All inbound traffic is **blocked** by default
* All outbound traffic is **authorised** by default

### Instances Purchasing Options

* `On-Demand Instances`
  * short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
  * highest cost but no upfront payment
* `Reserved` (1 & 3 years)
  * Reserved Instances ‚Äì long workloads
  * Convertible Reserved Instances ‚Äì long workloads with flexible instances
* `Savings Plans` (1 & 3 years)
  * commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
  * usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
  * locked to a specific instance family & AWS region
* `Spot Instances`
  * the **most cost-efficient** instances in AWS
  * short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
* `Dedicated Hosts`
  * book an entire physical server, control instance placement
  * allows address compliance requirements and use existing server- bound software licenses
  * The **most expensive** option
* `Dedicated Instances`
  * no other customers will share your hardware
  * may share hardware with other instances in same account
  * no control over instance placement
* `Capacity Reservations`
  * reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
  * no time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
  * suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

### AMI

> AMI: Amazon Machine Image

* AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  * You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
  * Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
* AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
* You can launch EC2 instances from:
  * A Public AMI: AWS provided
  * Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
  * An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

### EC2 Image Builder

* Used to **automate the creation** of Virtual Machines or container images
* Automate the creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs
* Can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updated, etc...)
* Free service (only pay for the underlying resources)

### EC2 Instance Store

> high-performance hardware disk

* Better I/O performance
* EC2 Instance Store **lose** their storage if they‚Äôre stopped (ephemeral)
* Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
* Risk of data loss if hardware fails
* Backups and Replication are your responsibility

### EBS Volume

> An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run

* It‚Äôs a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
  * It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  * It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
* It‚Äôs locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  * To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
* Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  * You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  * You can increase the capacity of the drive over time
* Delete on Termination attribute: Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  * By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
  * By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
  * This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
* EBS Snapshots
  * Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
  * Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
  * Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

### EFS

> Elastic File System

* Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
* EFS works with **Linux** EC2 instances in multi-AZ
* Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning
* EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA): Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day

  * Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies

## ELB & ASG

> ELB: Elastic Load Balancing  
> ASG: Auto Scaling Group

### High Availability & Scalability For EC2

* Vertical Scaling: Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
* Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances (= scale out / in)
* High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
  * Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
  * Load Balancer multi AZ

### Scalability vs Elasticity vs Agility

* `Scalability`: ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up), or by adding nodes (scale out)
* `Elasticity`: once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some ‚Äúauto-scaling‚Äù so that the system can scale based on the load.This is ‚Äúcloud-friendly‚Äù: pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs
* `Agility`: new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.

### Elastic Load Balancer

* An ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer
  * AWS guarantees that it will be working
  * AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
  * AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
* It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end (maintenance, integrations)
* 3 kinds of load balancers offered by AWS:
  * `Application Load Balancer` (HTTP / HTTPS only) ‚Äì Layer 7
  * `Network Load Balancer` (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) ‚Äì Layer 4
  * `Classic Load Balancer` (slowly retiring) ‚Äì Layer 4 & 7

### Auto Scaling Group

* In real-life, the load on your websites and application can change
* In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
* The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
  * Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
  * Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
  * Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
  * Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
  * Replace unhealthy instances
* Cost Savings: only run at an optimal capacity (principle of the cloud)
* Scaling Strategies
  * Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually
  * Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
    * Simple / Step Scaling
    * TargetTracking Scaling
    * Scheduled Scaling
  * Predictive Scaling: Uses Machine Learning to predict future traffic ahead of time

* Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù (directories)
* Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
* Buckets are **defined at the region level**
* S3 looks like a global service but buckets are **created in a region**
* Naming convention
  * No uppercase
  * No underscore
  * 3-63 characters long
  * Not an IP
  * Must start with lowercase letter or number

### Objects

* Objects (files) have a `Key`
  * The key is the **FULL path**
  * The key is composed of **prefix + object name**
  * There‚Äôs no concept of ‚Äúdirectories‚Äù within buckets despite of UI
  * Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (‚Äú/‚Äù)
* Object `Values` are the content of the body
* `Metadata` (list of text key / value pairs ‚Äì system or user metadata)
* `Tags` (Unicode key / value pair ‚Äì up to 10) ‚Äì useful for security / lifecycle
* `Version ID` (if versioning is enabled)

### Security

* User based
  * IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
* Resource Based
  * Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  * Object Access Control List (ACL) ‚Äì finer grain
  * Bucket Access Control List (ACL) ‚Äì less common
* Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  * the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
  * AND there‚Äôs no explicit DENY
* Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

### Versioning

* You can version your files in Amazon S3
* It is enabled at the bucket level
* Same key overwrite will increment the ‚Äúversion‚Äù: 1, 2, 3....
* It is best practice to version your buckets
  * Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  * Easy roll back to previous version
* Notes:
  * Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version ‚Äúnull‚Äù
  * Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

### Replication

* Must enable versioning in source and destination
* Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
* Buckets can be in different accounts
* Copying is asynchronous
* Cross Region Replication (CRR): compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
