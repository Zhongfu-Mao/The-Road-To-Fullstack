## Pre-Trained Models(APIs)

### Cognitive Services

> Bring AI within reach of every developer

* AI without building custom models
* Does NOT need machine-learning expertise
* Exposed as APIs

Services:

* Images/videos: Computer vision, Face API, Form Recognizer
* Text: Text Analytics, Translator Text, Text-to-Speech API
* Audio: Speech-to-Text API, Language Understanding Intelligent Service - LUIS
* Others:
  * Conversations (QnA Maker, Azure Bot Service)
  * Anomaly Detector service, Content moderator

### Vision Related APIs

* Computer Vision - Analyze content in images and videos
* Face API - Detect and identify people and emotions in images
* Custom Vision - Customize image recognition to fit your business

### Vision Terminology

* Image analysis: Extract tags from image
  * Create text description about an image
* Image classification: Classify image into different groups
* Object detection: Identify objects in image
  * For each object:
    * class of object, confidence level, coordinates of a bounding box
  * Goes deeper than image classification
* Face detection: Detect human faces
  * Face detection and analysis: Security, tag friends on facebook, Identity validation
* Optical character recognition (OCR): Detect text in images (license plates, invoices etc)

### FaceAPI

* Improve accuracy of face identification:
  * Quality of images (Higher face image quality)
    * Recommendations: frontal, clear, and face size - 200x200 pixels or bigger
  * Variety of images: From diff. angles in variety of lighting setups
* Important concepts:
  * FaceList (up to 1K faces) & LargeFaceList (up to 1M faces)
  * PersonGroup (up to 1K persons) & LargePersonGroup (up to 1M persons)
    * Each person can have multiple face images
* Operations:
  * Detect: Detect human faces (box co-ordinates)
  * Find Similar: Find similar faces (Find images of this specific person)
  * Group: Divide candidate faces (3-1000) into groups based on face similarity
  * Identify: 1-to-many identification
  * Verify
    * Do two faces belong to same person?
    * Does a face belong to a specific person?

### Form Recognizer API

Operations (over pdf or image):

* Analyze Business Card (Get Analyze Business Card Result)
* Analyze ID Document
* Analyze Invoice
* Analyze Receipt
* Custom Form: Design & extract key-value pairs, tables, and semantic values from custom documents - pdf or image

### Search APIs(Bing)

* Web Search API: Execute web search using API
* Image Search API: search for relevant images
* News Search API: search for relevant news articles
* Visual Search API: search based on an image

### Text Analytics API

> Text Analytics: Natural language processing (NLP)

Operations:

* Detect Language
  * Language Name,ISO 6391 Code, Score (NaN-ambiguous)
* Entities containing personal information
  * Returns a list of entities with personal information ("SSN", "Bank Account" etc) in the document
* Key Phrases: returns a list of strings denoting the key phrases
  * Example: Summarize a document
* Named Entity Recognition: list of general named entities in a given document
  * Person, Location, Organization, Quantity, DateTime, URL, Phone Number, IP Address etc
* Sentiment: detailed sentiment analysis
  * positive/negative review - example: 0.1(negative), 0.9(positive)

### Translator & Speech API

* Speech-to-Text API
* Text-to-Speech API
* Translation

### Conversational AI

* QnA Maker: Convert your FAQ into a Q&A Bot
  * You need a knowledge base (cannot talk to db)
* Azure Bot Service: Build your own bots
  * Enable multiple conversation channels(Alexa, Office 365 email, Facebook, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Slack, Telegram ....)
* Recommended Architecture: QnA Maker service + Azure Bot Service

### LUIS: Language Understanding Intelligence Service

* Understands spoken (and text) commands
* Detects Intents (FoodOrder, BookFlight) and Entities (Pizzas, Cairo)

### Understanding Decision Services

* Anamaly Detector: Find anomalies
* Content Moderator: Detect unwanted content

## Building ML Models

### Steps

1: Obtain Data
2: Clean Data
3: Feature Engineering: Identify Features and Label
4: Create a Model using the Dataset and the ML algorithm 5: Evaluate the accuracy of the model
6: Deploy the model for use

### Terminology

* Process
  * Training: The process of creating a model
  * Evaluation: Is the model working?
  * Inference: Using model to do predictions in production
* Dataset: Data used to create, validate & test the model
  * Features: Inputs
  * Label: Output/Prediction
  * Dataset Types
    * Training Dataset: Dataset used to create a model
    * Validation Dataset: Dataset used to validate the model (and choose the right algorithm) - Model Evaluation
    * Testing Dataset: Dataset used to do final testing before deployment

### Azure Machine Learning

* Azure Machine Learning: Simplifies creation of your models
  * Manage data, code, compute, models etc
  * Prepare data
  * Train models
  * Publish models
  * Monitor models
* Multiple options to create models
  * Automated machine learning: Build custom models with minimum ML expertise
  * Azure Machine Learning designer: Enables no-code development of models
    * Build Your Own Models: Data Scientists
    * Data and compute management, pipelines

Terminology:

* Studio: Website for Azure Machine Learning
* Workspace: Top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning
  * Azure Machine Learning designer: drag-and-drop interface to create your ML workflows(Canvas)
