## Data Formats & Data Stores

### Data Formats

* Structured: Tables, Rows and Columns (Relational)
* Semi Structured: Key-Value, Document (JSON), Graph, etc
* Unstructured: Video, Audio, Image, Text files, Binary files ...

### Data Stores

* Relational databases
* NoSQL databases
* Analytical databases
* Object/Block/File storage

### Relational Database

#### OLTP(Online Transaction Processing)

> Applications where large number of users make large number (millions) of transactions  
> Transaction - small, discrete, unit of work

Azure Managed Services:

* Azure SQL Database: Managed Microsoft SQL Server
* Azure Database for MySQL: Managed MySQL
* Azure Database for PostgreSQL: Managed PostgreSQL

#### OLAP(Online Analytics Processing)

> Applications allowing users to analyze petabytes of data  
> Data is consolidated from multiple (typically transactional) databases

Azure Managed Service: Azure Synapse Analytics

* Petabyte-scale distributed data warehouse
* Unified experience for developing end-to-end analytics solutions
* Data integration + Data warehouse + Data analytics
* Run complex queries across petabytes of data
* Earlier called Azure SQL Data Warehouse

#### OLAP vs OLTP

* OLTP databases use **row storage**
  * Each table row is stored together
  * Efficient for processing small transactions
* OLAP databases use **columnar storage**
  * Each table column is stored together
  * High compression - store petabytes of data efficiently
  * Distribute data - one table in multiple cluster nodes
  * Execute single query across multiple nodes - Complex queries can be executed efficiently

### Semi Structure Data

> Managed Service: Azure Cosmos DB

#### Document

> Managed Service: Azure Cosmos DB SQL API & MongoDB API

#### Key Value

* Similar to a HashMap
  * Key - Unique identifier to retrieve a specific value
  * Value - Number or a String or a complex object, like a JSON file
  * Supports simple lookups - query by keys
    * NOT optimized for query by values
    * Typically, no other indexes allowed
* Use cases: Session Store, Caching Data
* Managed Services: Azure Cosmos DB Table API, Azure Table Storage

#### Graph

* Contains nodes and edges (relationships)
* Use cases: People and relationships, Organizational charts, Fraud Detection
* Managed Service: Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API

#### Column Family

* Data organized into rows and columns
* Can appear similar to a relational database
* IMPORTANT FEATURE: Columns are divided into groups called column-family
  * Rows can be sparse (does NOT need to have value for every column)
* Use cases: IOT streams and real time analytics, financial data - transaction histories, stock prices etc
* Managed Service: Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API

### Unstructured Data

* Block Storage (Azure Managed Service: Azure Disks)
* File Storage (Azure Managed Service: Azure Files)
* Object Storage (Azure Managed Service: Azure Blob Storage)

## Relational Databases

* Recommended when strong transactional consistency guarantees are needed
* Database **schema is mandatory**
* Azure Managed Services:
  * Azure SQL Database
  * Azure SQL Managed Instance
  * Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  * Azure Database for MySQL
  * Azure Database for MariaDB

### SQL(Structured Query Language)

* SQL: Language used to perform operations on relational databases
* Data Definition Language (DDL): Create and modify structure of database objects
  * Create: Create a database or its constituent objects (Table, View, Index etc)
  * Drop: Delete objects (Table, View, Index) from database
  * Alter: Alter structure of the database
  * Rename: Rename an existing object
* Data Query Language (DQL): Perform queries on the data
* Data Manipulation Language (DML): Insert, update or delete data
  * Select: Read rows from a table
  * Insert: Insert new rows into a table
  * Update: Modify data in existing rows
  * Delete: Delete existing rows
* Data Control Language (DCL): Manage permissions and other controls
  * Grant: Grant permission to perform specific actions
  * Deny: Deny permission to perform specific actions
  * Revoke: Remove a previously granted permission
  * Example: `Grant and revoke user access - GRANT SELECT ON course TO user1`
* Transaction Control Language(TCL): Control transactions within a database
  * Commit - commits a transaction
  * Rollback - rollbacks a transaction (used in case of an error)

### Index

* Allows efficient data retrieval from a database
* Combination of one or more columns
* An index is automatically created with the primary key
* A table can have more than one index
* Two Types of Indexes:
  * Clustered: Data in table is stored in the order of the index key values
    * Only one clustered index per table ( Why? - data rows can only be sorted in one way)
  * Non-clustered indexes: Index stored separately with pointers to the data rows

### View

* View: Virtual table mapped to a query
* Can be used just like a table in SQL queries
* Use cases: Add calculated columns, join multiple tables, filter unnecessary columns

### Normalization

* Goals in designing relational databases:
  * High Data Integrity
  * Minimum Data Redundancy (or Duplication)
* Database Normalization: "Process of restructuring a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity"
  * First Normal Form (1NF): Single(atomic) valued columns Violation
  * Second Normal Form (2NF): Eliminate redundant data
  * Third Normal Form (3NF): Move columns not directly dependent on primary key
  * There are other normal forms (4NF, 5NF, ...) but 3NF is considered good enough for most relational data
* A simple definition for practical purposes is:
  * Separate each entity into its own table.
  * Separate each discrete attribute into its own column.
  * Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a primary key.
  * Use foreign key columns to link related entities.
* Advantages of Normalization
  * Avoid same data being duplicated in multiple tables
  * Reduce disk space wastage Avoid data inconsistencies

### Transaction

> Transaction: Sequence of operations that need to be atomic  
> All operations are successful (commit) OR NONE are successful (rollback)

* Properties: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
  * Atomicity: Each transaction is atomic (either succeeds completely, or fails completely)
  * Consistency: Database must be consistent before and after the transaction
  * Isolation: Multiple Transactions occur independently
  * Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it remains committed even if there are system failures (a power outage, for example)
* Supported in all Relational Databases

* A table can hold several versions of data, enabling an application to query the data as it appeared at some point in the past.

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL

> PostgreSQL is a hybrid relational-object database.  
> You can store data in relational tables, but a PostgreSQL database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties.  
> PostgreSQL has its own query language called pgsql. This language is a variant of the standard relational query language, SQL, with features that enable you to write stored procedures that run inside the database.

  * From different OS: Windows, Linux, and macOS
* Supports two common network file sharing protocols:
  * Server Message Block (SMB) file sharing is commonly used across multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
  * Network File System (NFS) shares are used by some Linux and macOS versions. To create an NFS share, you must use a premium tier storage account and create and configure a virtual network through which access to the share can be controlled.
* Usecase: Shared files between multiple VMs (example: configuration files)

* Terminology: Data warehouse vs Data lake
  * Data warehouse: PBs of Storage + Compute (Typically)
    * A data warehouse is a relational database in which the data is stored in a schema that is optimized for data analytics rather than transactional workloads
    * Optimized for **read** operations
    * Data stored in a format ready for specific analysis! (processed data)
      * Examples: Teradata, BigQuery(GCP), Redshift(AWS), Azure Synapse Analytics
    * Typically uses specialized hardware
  * Data lake: Typically retains all raw data (compressed)
    * A data lake is a file store, usually on a distributed file system for high performance data access.
    * Typically object storage is used as data lake
      * Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 etc..
    * Flexibility while saving cost
